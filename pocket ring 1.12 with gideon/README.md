So, this is the Pocket Ring mod for Elden Ring. Or Poke-Gaol. Or Gaolkeymon. I have no fucking idea. Pocket Ring - Pokemon Spirit Summon Overhaul.

How the fuck do you use this shit? Read the Gideon README and use the thing to get the fancy icons n shit. It doesn't matter too much, icons aren't that important, but they're nice to have.

Well, you just beat enemies over their heads until they glow blue. Then use the Gaol Pots to capture them.

Stronger enemies have a lower %chance to be caught.
For example, the Lion Guardian has a 1 in 4 chance of dropping, compared to the Godrick Soldier, who almost always drops.

Most of the instruction is pretty easy to understand. Also, the amount of Gaolkeymons and other Pocket Ring related items you can have is determined by Ritual Pots.
Either spend Golden Seeds to obtain Ritual Pots or defeat Catacomb Bosses.

You can make Gaolkeymon perform moves, such as Malenia, use Waterfowl Dance! (Use Attack Talisman 39.)
Attack Talismans (Talismen?) can be bought in the crafting shop, along with everything else.
Attack Talismen don't work if the Gaolkeymon is in the middle of attacking.
The higher the Attack Talisman number, the longer the animation takes. This is because the higher Attack Talisman Numbered attacks are usually better.
The Description of the Gaolkeymon contains Lucky Numbers. These are the attacks the Gaolkeymon knows.

You can pick a starter Gaolkeymon in the crafting shop. 
I personally recommend the Giant Miranda Flower if you don't like Soldier of Godrick, though for shits and giggles, select the MIGHTY BALLISTA (your lucky number is 1.)
Or you can save up your Golden Seeds to spend on THE WORLD or randomized buffs.

THE WORLD does what you fucking think it does.

Randomized buffs, just buy the token and use it. It'll give you a buff. T1, T2, and T3 buffs are not mutually exclusive, though the buffs themselves are.
This means that 2 T1 Phys Damage boosts don't stack but a T1 Phys Damage boost and a T2 Phys Damage boost will.

Gaolkeymon also share your iframes. 
Using Quickstep, rolling, and some attacks like Dynast Finesse or Bloodhound Finesse will make you and your Gaolkeymon glow red. That's the indicator.

Gaolkeymon also share your talisman slots and most consumable items.

All talisman buffs are increased by 100%.

For example, this means that consuming Exalted Flesh will boost your Gaolkeymon's attack power.
This also means that equipping the Assassin's Crimson Dagger and backstabbing your Gaolkeymon is a viable way of healing them and you.

There is also a Dynamic Camera Opt-In option. Just buy the thing in the store if you want to have a better camera during some big fights.
Discard the Dynamic Camera item if you don't want this anymore.

The scaling of enemy damage has been reduced, but all enemy HP is multiplied by 1.5x. This does not apply to Gaolkeymon.

With all that out of the way, have fun!
